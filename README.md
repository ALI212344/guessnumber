## Features

# Interactive Guessing Game

A fun and engaging game where you guess a number or solve challenges!

## How it Works

The game generates a random number within a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100). Your goal is to guess the number in as few attempts as possible. After each guess, you’ll receive feedback: whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

## Types of Challenges

*   **Standard Guessing Mode:** Guess the random number generated within a fixed range (e.g., 1–100).
*   **Time Challenge:** Solve the game within a limited amount of time.
*   **Attempts Challenge:** Guess the correct number with the least possible number of attempts to achieve a high score.

## Interactive Features

*   **Dynamic Feedback:** Receive real-time hints like “Too High” or “Too Low.”
*   **Progress Tracking:** See the number of attempts you’ve made.
*   **Difficulty Levels:** Play in easy, medium, or hard mode with varying number ranges and hints.
*   **Responsive Design:** Works well on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
*   **Multiple Pages:**
    *   Coming Soon Page (`comingsoon.html`)
    *   Alternate Coming Soon Page (`comingsoonAL.html`)
    *   Contact Us Page (`contactus.html`)
    *   Team Information Page (`team.html`)
