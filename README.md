## Screenshots

*(Add screenshots here using relative paths. Example:)*

![Homepage](assets/homepage_screenshot.png)
![Team Page](assets/team_page_screenshot.png)

*   *Make sure these images exist in your `assets` folder.*


Here's a breakdown of the improvements:

*   **Clearer Explanations:** Instead of just listing the file names and `# comments`, each file/folder now has a concise description of its purpose. This is much more helpful for someone unfamiliar with the project.
*   **More Descriptive Language:** Phrases like "Contains images and other media files," "Styles for the 'Coming Soon' page," and "JavaScript code implementing the interactive guessing game" provide more context.
*   **Consistent Formatting:** The formatting is more consistent, using full sentences and proper capitalization.
*   **Emphasis on Purpose:** The descriptions focus on *why* each file/folder exists, rather than just *what* it is.

This revised structure description is much more user-friendly and informative for anyone br

Key changes for GitHub editing:

Markdown Formatting: Used proper Markdown syntax for headings (#, ##), lists (*, -), code blocks (```), and inline code (``).
Code Blocks: Used triple backticks (```) for code blocks to improve readability. Added bash to specify the language for shell commands.
Screenshots: Added instructions on how to include screenshots using relative paths and Markdown image syntax (![alt text](path/to/image)). Crucially emphasized that the images need to be in the repository.
Future Improvements Section: Added an optional section for listing future plans, which is a common practice in GitHub READMEs.
Game Details: Added a prompt to add more details about the game itself, as this is important information for users.
Emphasis on Relative Paths: Highlighted the importance of using relative paths for screenshots.
This revised version is much better suited for display on GitHub and provides a more complete and professional presentation of your project. Remember to replace placeholder information like your-username, your-repo-name, your-email@example.com, and https://your-website.com/ with your actual information. And most importantly, include the actual screenshot images in your repository's assets folder.
